# ce06 Interfaces (ADTs)

This class exercise is designed to get you aquainted with Interfaces in Java.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* A basic understanding of creating and implementing interfaces in Java.
* https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/interfaces/interfaces.md

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `cs1302-ce06`:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce06.git
   ```
1. Change into the `cs1302-ce06` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```
   
   For each Java file in the `cs1302-ce06` subdirectory, fill out a table similar to the following:
   
   | Name of the Java file | Interface or Implementing Class | Fully Qualified Name (FQN) |
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   |-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   
1. List the abstract methods found in the `Driveable` interface.

1. Generate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package. 
   Host the documentation on Nike using `cs1302-ce06-doc` as the name for your symbolic link.
   What is the URL to your hosted website?
   
1. Look at the `speedUp` method in the `Car.java` file. Compare the Javadoc comment for the
   method in that file to the documentation listed for that method in the API documentation
   website. What do you notice? How is this possible?

**CHECKPOINT**

1. Make sure that you are still in the `cs1302-ce06` directory. Compile `Drivable.java` and place the compiled
   code under the `bin` directory. Notice that interfaces are compiled the same way as classes.
   
1. Compile `Car.java`.  Uh-oh.  What compile-time error was generated?  Why did you receive this error?
   Modify `Car.java` to fix the error and recompile.
   
1. Compile and execute `Driver.java`. It should run properly once `Car.java` is compiled. For now, we only
   have a single class (`Car.java`) that implements `Drivable`. Notice that the `test` method in `Driver.java`
   takes an argument of type `Car`. For now this is okay--just observe what is going on.
   
1. Each person in the group should think of two different types of things in real life that are capable of
   being driven. In your notes, include the items from your list as well as your favorite among the
   ones generated by your group. As a group, pick one and note it as best--play nice.

1. Add a class to the `cs1302.ce06.impl` package that represents your group's best type. That type should
   be something that is capable of being driven and therefore a perfect candidate for a class that implements 
   the `Drivable` interface. Therefore, make sure that your class properly implements the interface. Also
   make sure that your class compiles. What is the command that you used to compile your class?
   
1. Update `Driver.java` to test your new class. You probably don't want to create a separate `test` method as
   the existing `test`. Rewrite the `test` method so it can be used to test `Car` objects and objects of the
   new type that you just created. *Note*: You should also update Javadoc comments where necessary.

**CHECKPOINT**

1. Add a method `stop` to `Drivable.java`.  Compile your code.  What happened?  Why?

1. Fix the errors generated in the previous step.  Add Javadoc comments where necessary.

1. Update the hosted documentation on nike.
